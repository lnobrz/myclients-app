        <li>

            NodeJS 18^ is required to run this client locally. Full NodeJS

            If you want to, you can run our server locally too. Full
            documentation here

            If you're going to run our server locally, you'll need to change the
            url prop passed on the LinkButton of the Auth Page. Just go to
            src/pages/Auth.tsx and replace the LinkButton component url to "localhost:8080".
